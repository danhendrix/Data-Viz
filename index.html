<h1>This is the thing.</h1>
<p>My name is Danny Hendrix. I work as a financial analyst for a metals recycling company here in Portland
	and I want to expand my knowledge of data anaysis. We routinely use basic power point presentations and
	pretty unsophisticated methods of displaying information and I would love to improve my knowledge in this area.<br>
	<br>In my spare time I play a lot of basketball, like to perform improv and sketch comedy in town, and play blues guitar,
	which is super out of style right now.</p>
